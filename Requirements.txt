Stripe Integration
* Users should have  astripe customer token in the users table
* Javascript should prevent pro form from submitting, when user fills it out, 
and should send card info to Stripe.
* Javascript  should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
